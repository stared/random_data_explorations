# Ideas

* another step to separate xml content?
* LDA with Gensim for topic modeling (and pyLDAvis!)
* looking for misspelled tags (and: plural vs singular, US vs GB, hyphen vs underscore...)
* TagOverflow (JS? publically accesible?)
* interactive for showing the most popular tag for given day/week/month/year
* some tag2vec? (TensorFlow? factorization machines?)
* some blog post?
